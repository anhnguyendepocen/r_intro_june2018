# Lecture Notes

The workshops consist of the presenter live coding and explaining material as the workshop participants also write the same codes and commands.  These lecture notes are the general script.  Presenters may deviate from this, but if you're working on your own, you want reference material, you'd like to follow along, or you've gotten behind in the workshop, these are good reference.

For each part, there is an RMarkdown file (*.Rmd) that you can open in RStudio, or there is an html file you can view.  Links to the HTML files for the easiest viewing are:

* [Part 1: Basics and Data Types](https://nuitrcs.github.io/r_intro_june2018/corelecturenotes/part1_basics_and_datatypes.html)
* [Part 2: Data Structures](https://nuitrcs.github.io/r_intro_june2018/corelecturenotes/part2_data_structures.html)
* [Part 3: Reading and Writing Files](https://nuitrcs.github.io/r_intro_june2018/corelecturenotes/part3_reading_writing.html)
* [Part 4: Data Manipulation](https://nuitrcs.github.io/r_intro_june2018/corelecturenotes/part4_data_manipulation.html)
* [Part 5: Visualization](https://nuitrcs.github.io/r_intro_june2018/corelecturenotes/part5_visualization.html)
* [Part 6: Loops, If Statements, Functions](https://nuitrcs.github.io/r_intro_june2018/corelecturenotes/part6_loops_conditionals_functions.html)

They are all stand-alone files, so you can download them from the links if you'd like.

The parts generally follow in order, other than Part 6 could come anywhere after Part 2 as needed.
