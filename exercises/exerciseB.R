# Exercise B

# we're going to do some random draws, so set the 
# random seed so we get the same results
set.seed(1234) 

# Vector with 5 random (normal) values

x1 <- rnorm(5)
x1

# Which values in x1 are less than 0?
# Compare x1 to 0


# Create another vector named x2 with 5 random (normal) values in it
# drawn from distribution with mean 0.5; 
# look in the distributions section on the reference card


# Compare the maximum values of each vector;
# Is the max of x1 greater than x2?
# look in the Math section of the reference card for function name


# Compare the mean values of each vector;
# Is the mean of x1 greater than x2?
# look in the Math section of the reference card for function name


# Add the values 2, 3, and 4 to the end of x1
